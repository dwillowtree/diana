        4. Some good examples are: threat hunting in Okta logs, TTPs used in AWS attacks, detection engineering in CloudTrail logs, hunting in SaaS logs, writing detections in Kubernetes audit logs, and detection engineering in EKS logs.
        5. Document each TTP with detailed descriptions, including the context of its use, how it manifests in logs, and why it is a good candidate for detection.
